# div-sketch
    2500 divs used to make a fake canvas. 

Click to enable the pen and move the mouse to draw.
Clicking once more will stop drawing.
Pressing 'space' resets the drawing and swaps to a new color.
div-sketch can be fun for drawing some quick pixel art.

Please do NOT use this for anything in production, use the canvas element instead.
Happy sketching :)
